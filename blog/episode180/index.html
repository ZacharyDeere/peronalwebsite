			<h3>Episode 180:</h3>
            <h4>Showdown in the Ancient Ruins! Sky God Eneru’s Goal!</h4>
			<p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>Gan Fall, Wyper, Roronoa Zoro, and Nico Robin finally come face to face 
			with Eneru after a long journey to the top of the Upper Yard in Skypiea. Eneru
			explains that he is only leaving the Upper Yard to search for the place called
			God’s Home, a place where the lang extends for miles and miles. For some reason,
			Eneru has a fascination with land, thus explains why he took over the Upper Yard
			which consists of the only dirt in Skypiea. Rather than just leaving peacefully 
			to search for this land Eneru decides that Skypiea is needs to be destroyed due 
			to it being in the air and not attached to the Earth. In rage the party of four 
			all attack Eneru one by one. Eneru electrocutes the attackers with his Rumble-Rumble
			devil fruit powers causing them to faint and appear dead. Wyper being the only 
			attacker left, leaps onto Eneru and pushes his palms, that holds a sea prism stone,
			into Eneru’s chest. This particular stone can overpower anyone who possesses devil 
			fruit powers. Trembling, Eneru exclaims that if Wyper goes through with his plan of 
			action they would both die from the stone’s blast.</p> 
			
			<p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>This is one of the most climatic episodes in the ark so far. However, between each
			fighter taking their stand against Eneru the episode cuts to a flashback when Eneru
			first came and took over the island. The flashbacks were very slow and did not match
			the fast paced action that the episode had going. There was a certain point when I was
			very close to just skipping the flashbacks to simply get back to the action. I believe
			that the flashbacks should have been incorporated into a separate episode and left this
			episode to be action filled. Nonetheless, the episode led up to a wonderful ending leaving
			me wondering if Wyper is going to use the stone to kill Eneru and himself.</p>
