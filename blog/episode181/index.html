			<h3>Episode 181:</h3>
            <h4>Ambition Toward the Endless Vearth! The Ark Maxim!</h4>
			<p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>At the very beginning Wyper decides to use the sea prism 
			stone shooting Eneru and himself forcefully in opposite directions. Wyper lands on his 
			feet while Eneru lays on the ground presumably dead. Eneru shortly after uses his devil 
			fruit power to restart his heart. With dismay Wyper falls to his knees in shock and in 
			pain while Eneru begins to stand back up. Eneru electrocutes Wyper once again however 
			Wyper still continues to stand back up. Wyper expresses that he continues to fight due 
			to his ancestors’ struggle. Eneru follows up by electrocuting him one last time, a shock
			so large that it looks like might have killed Wyper. In fury Zoro stands and picks up 
			the sea prism stone and charges straight for Eneru. Just as he did with Wyper, Eneru 
			electrocutes Zoro leaving him charred and unconscious.</p>
			
			<p>At this point, Nami, who had been hiding during the fight, yells out and Eneru informs
			her that she is the last one still alive. Rather than trying to fight Eneru she decides
			to join him on his journey. However, it is very apparent that she is trying to escape 
			death. Eneru escorts Nami to his ship that he claims can only be controlled by lightning
			and is made of out the gold that he stole from the Upper Yard.</p>
			
			<p>Monkey D. Luffy and Aisa finally make it to the Upper Yard and sees all of their friends
			charred and unconscious. Robin finally come to and is able to relay to Luffy that Eneru
			and Nami went destroy Skypiea. Aisa explains the she knows exactly where they went.</p>
			
			<p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>It is so upsetting that Luffy took forever to finally reach the 
			Upper Yard. Remember that since Luffy has the powers of the Gum-Gum fruit, he is made of 
			rubber. Therefore, I think it is pretty safe to assume that Eneru’s electric powers would
			be obsolete when it comes to Luffy because he is literally an insulator. With that being 
			said though I have a feeling that Eneru’s days are numbered once Luffy finally finds him.</p>
			
			<p>The episode seemed to keep the action going much better than episode 180 did. Flashbacks
			were still intermixed with the on going action but they did not intrude 
			on important scenes.</p>
