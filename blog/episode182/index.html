			<h3>Episode 182:</h3>
            <h4>They Finally Clash! Pirate Luffy vs. God Eneru!</h4>
			<p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>Eneru explains to Nami that with his mantra gave him ability to
			listen to what everyone in Skypiea is saying, therefore he can electrocute anyone who speaks
			bad of him. Nami begins to conjure up ideas of how to escape. However, before Nami can say 
			anything to Eneru he cuts her off and asks if she can hear anyone nearby.</p>
			
			<p>Separately, Conis shows up to Angel Island trying to tell everyone to hurry and leave 
			before he comes and kills them all. Unfortunately, not a single person would listen and 
			demanded that she goes to prison for slandering God Eneru’s name. In anger, Conis screams 
			out, “I refuse to accept that Eneru is god.” This type of behavior normally follows with a
			bolt of lightning coming down and striking the person. All of the townspeople runs far away
			from Conis because they believe the bolt is about to strike her. After realizing that the 
			bolt was not coming, the townspeople began to believe Conis and evacuated immediately.</p>
			
			<p>Like promised Aisa lead Luffy right to Nami and Eneru. After a few minutes of reckless
			talking, Luffy runs up the side of the boat and slingshots himself straight toward Eneru.
			Eneru answered by shocking Luffy three times each stronger than the last. After all three
			bolts, Luffy stood tall as if nothing even happened and that's when a Eneru realized he 
			was made of rubber. The episode ends with Luffy connecting one solid punch on Eneru.</p>
			
			<p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>Most importantly, I would like to say that my prediction
			from the previous episode stands true. I don’t know about you, but seeing Eneru’s lightning
			fail and getting knocked down gave my a rush. Eneru has killed so many people in this Ark
			so it is about time that he starts getting what he deserves. I predict and hope that Luffy
			is able to defeat Eneru thus letting the Shandorians take back the Upper yard as their own
			and letting the townspeople of Angel Island come back to their homes. This episode did a
			wonderful job at building suspense. I am beyond excited to start episode 183!</p>
