			<h3>Episode 183:</h3>
            <h4>Maxim Surfaces! Deathpiea is Activated!</h4>
			<p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>
			Eneru struggles to get up off the ground then questions Luffy on why
			his lightning is not affecting him. Luffy tells him that he is made
			of rubber and this surprises Eneru because he has no idea what rubber
			is due to there not being any on Skypiea. Eneru is still able to use
			his mantra to predict Luffy’s moves therefore Luffy does not land that
			many hits. Somehow with Eneru’s powers he is about to transform is 
			staff into a blade that can be used to hurt Luffy. Back and forth they
			exchange punches and try to outsmart each other with every action. Eneru
			heated up his blade therefore when Luffy would grab ahold it would melt 
			his rubber body. While Luffy was panicking from the heat of the blade, 
			Eneru grabbed his arms and swung him into the ship’s deck leaving him 
			presumably unconscious.
			</p> 
			
			<p>While Luffy was down, Eneru walked over to his throne so he could start
			moving the ship. Using his electric abilities he raised the ship named
			Maxim into the sky. Since the ship is so massive it struggles to lift
			itself over the ground but ends up plowing through the island and its trees.
			Luffy finally comes to and walks up to Eneru at the throne. Eneru proclaims,
			“Deathpiea Activate”, subsequently black thunderclouds begin to bellow out
			of the smokestack of Maxim. Eneru explains that the thunderclouds will
			engulf Skypiea completely and upon doing so, he will release all of the energy
			at once ripping apart Skypiea and letting it fall out of the sky. He proves
			his capabilities by striking a bolt right in the middle of Angel Island 
			destroying many houses.</p>
			
			<p>Eneru and Luffy break out into another fight and Eneru continues to predict
			Luffy and burning him with his blade. Luffy contemplates how he is going
			to defeat someone that can predict his every move. Luffy being trying to be
			clever decides to go limp and as Nami stated, “be a blade of grass”. In 
			this state of mind Luffy relies on his reflexes to dodge and this works 
			because Eneru can not read his mind because Luffy is not thinking. The downfall
			to this is that Luffy is incapable of fighting back he can only dodge.</p>
			
			<p>Luffy then thinks of a brilliant idea. He starts attacking the Maxim,
			however since the ship is made out of gold all of his punches are being
			bounced back and shooting behind him. Eneru thinks that this is a great
			time to attack, but while Eneru is charging at Luffy all of Luffy’s punches
			are connecting with Eneru. This is happening because technically Luffy is
			thinking about destroying the ship not hitting Eneru therefore Eneru can not
			predict it. While Eneru is winded and out of his headspace, Luffy comes running
			up to Eneru and is about to land a huge punch when the episode ends.</p>
			
			<p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>
			This episode is an absolute rollercoaster! There are several different
			instances where it looks like Eneru is going to win, but then Luffy springs
			back with some good hits and it leaves you almost chanting for Luffy. Also,
			I’m very curious to see if Luffy defeats Eneru and if he does, will the 
			thunderclouds continue to bellow out of the Maxim. I am wondering this because
			you would think that even if Eneru is not there to control the lightning, 
			they could still strike and destroy Skypiea. Even if this does happen I believe
			Luffy and the strawhats can figure out someway to deflect the thunder clouds.
			Lastly, if Maxim gets destroyed I wonder what the gold will be used for. The 
			skypieans have never used or seen gold before so it is not used as riches. 
			Hopefully they will use the gold to make a monument to celebrate their independence
			from Eneru.
