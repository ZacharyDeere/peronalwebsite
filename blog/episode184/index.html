			<h3>Episode 184:</h3>
            <h4>Luffy Falls! Eneru's Judgment and Nami's Wish!</h4>
			<p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>
			Picking up from the end of the last episode, the punch thrown by Luffy that was cut short
			ended up connecting sending Eneru flying across the Maxim. From the looks
			of it all you can see is the whites of Eneru’s eyes, which would mean that
			Luffy knocked him out. However, seconds later Eneru managed to get on his
			knees and was spitting blood. Struggling to stand Eneru continued to announce
			that he is unbeatable and the almighty god. He reassured Luffy that he was
			going to defeat him and make him feel ashamed.</p>
			
			<p>At this point Maxim finally gathered up enough momentum to lift into the
			sky. The townspeople of Angel Island were already evacuating, but seeing the
			ship in the sky with the thunderclouds bellowing out made them hurry much faster.</p>
			
			<p>Back aboard the ship Eneru blocks one of Luffy’s punches by melting a ball
			of gold off of the ship and forcing it to dry around Luffy’s arm leaving him
			weighed down. While Luffy was helpless Eneru rolls the gold ball off of the
			ship thinking that the weight of the ball would immediately send him flying
			toward the ground. Much to Eneru’s surprise Luffy is able to brace himself by
			holding onto the ship’s railing. This does not last long though, Eneru destroys
			the railing causing Luffy to fall.</p>
			
			<p>Aisa and Pierre (Gan Fall’s mythical pet) notice Luffy falling and fly under
			the ship in an attempt to catch him. However, Eneru notices them and sends a huge
			lightning bolt in their direction. Eneru assumes that the bolt killed all three of
			the individuals and continues on. At first Eneru’s destination was for the edge of
			the island, but he changed his course after remembering the golden bell that Robin
			said was hidden on the island. At this point Nami was fulling rejecting Eneru’s ideas
			and openly told Eneru that he is dumb for wanting treasure and not friendships.
			Eneru became frustrated with Nami and decided that he is going to kill her.</p>
			
			<p>Meanwhile back on the Going Merry, the Strawhat's Ship, Usopp and Sanji finally
			wake up after being unconscious and ill for the past few days from a fight with
			Eneru. Sanji and Usopp spot Nami alone with Eneu amongst the Maxim and seek out
			to rescue her. Using Usopp’s gadget called the “Usopp AAaaaAAAaaaAA,” Usopp and
			Sanji manage to grapple hook the Maxim as it passed over head. The episode ends
			with Eneru about to attack Nami while Usopp and Sanji climb up the rope to board
			the Maxim.</p>
			
			<p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>
			I truly believe that Usopp and Sanji will make it in time to protect Nami. Although,
			I do not think that the duo can defeat Eneru. I believe that in the next episode
			while Usopp and Sanji are attempting to take on Eneru, Pierre will appear in the
			distance with Aisa and Luffy on his back. Thus, Luffy will step back in and try
			his luck back in battle. I think this because Luffy has been the only opponent
			besides Wyper to successfully hurt Eneru. On the other hand, I would love for Usopp
			and Sanji to prove me wrong. Usopp is known for his crazy gadgets and seeing him
			pull one out of his pouch to take down Eneru would not be much of a surprise.</p>
			
			<p>The Skypiea ark has felt very drawn out and lacking in substance. I hate to
			say this but I am getting tired of being in the sky and am ready for our beloved
			Straw Hat crew to be back in the ocean. Seeing Eneru finally defeated and the crew
			returning to the blue sea will be a relieving moment.</p>
