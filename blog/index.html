			<!-- <h3>Episode 180:</h3> -->
            <!-- <h4> Showdown in the Ancient Ruins! Sky God Eneru’s Goal!</h4> -->
			<!-- <p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>Gan Fall, Wyper, Roronoa Zoro, and Nico Robin finally come face to face  -->
			<!-- with Eneru after a long journey to the top of the Upper Yard in Skypiea. Eneru -->
			<!-- explains that he is only leaving the Upper Yard to search for the place called -->
			<!-- God’s Home, a place where the lang extends for miles and miles. For some reason, -->
			<!-- Eneru has a fascination with land, thus explains why he took over the Upper Yard -->
			<!-- which consists of the only dirt in Skypiea. Rather than just leaving peacefully  -->
			<!-- to search for this land Eneru decides that Skypiea is needs to be destroyed due  -->
			<!-- to it being in the air and not attached to the Earth. In rage the party of four  -->
			<!-- all attack Eneru one by one. Eneru electrocutes the attackers with his Rumble-Rumble -->
			<!-- devil fruit powers causing them to faint and appear dead. Wyper being the only  -->
			<!-- attacker left, leaps onto Eneru and pushes his palms, that holds a sea prism stone, -->
			<!-- into Eneru’s chest. This particular stone can overpower anyone who possesses devil  -->
			<!-- fruit powers. Trembling, Eneru exclaims that if Wyper goes through with his plan of  -->
			<!-- action they would both die from the stone’s blast.</p>  -->
			
			<!-- <p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>This is one of the most climatic episodes in the ark so far. However, between each -->
			<!-- fighter taking their stand against Eneru the episode cuts to a flashback when Eneru -->
			<!-- first came and took over the island. The flashbacks were very slow and did not match -->
			<!-- the fast paced action that the episode had going. There was a certain point when I was -->
			<!-- very close to just skipping the flashbacks to simply get back to the action. I believe -->
			<!-- that the flashbacks should have been incorporated into a separate episode and left this -->
			<!-- episode to be action filled. Nonetheless, the episode led up to a wonderful ending leaving -->
			<!-- me wondering if Wyper is going to use the stone to kill Eneru and himself.</p> -->

			<!-- <h3>Episode 181:</h3> -->
            <!-- <h4>Ambition Toward the Endless Vearth! The Ark Maxim!</h4> -->
			<!-- <p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>At the very beginning Wyper decides to use the sea prism  -->
			<!-- stone shooting Eneru and himself forcefully in opposite directions. Wyper lands on his  -->
			<!-- feet while Eneru lays on the ground presumably dead. Eneru shortly after uses his devil  -->
			<!-- fruit power to restart his heart. With dismay Wyper falls to his knees in shock and in  -->
			<!-- pain while Eneru begins to stand back up. Eneru electrocutes Wyper once again however  -->
			<!-- Wyper still continues to stand back up. Wyper expresses that he continues to fight due  -->
			<!-- to his ancestors’ struggle. Eneru follows up by electrocuting him one last time, a shock -->
			<!-- so large that it looks like might have killed Wyper. In fury Zoro stands and picks up  -->
			<!-- the sea prism stone and charges straight for Eneru. Just as he did with Wyper, Eneru  -->
			<!-- electrocutes Zoro leaving him charred and unconscious.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <p>At this point, Nami, who had been hiding during the fight, yells out and Eneru informs -->
			<!-- her that she is the last one still alive. Rather than trying to fight Eneru she decides -->
			<!-- to join him on his journey. However, it is very apparent that she is trying to escape  -->
			<!-- death. Eneru escorts Nami to his ship that he claims can only be controlled by lightning -->
			<!-- and is made of out the gold that he stole from the Upper Yard.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <p>Monkey D Luffy and Isa finally make it to the Upper Yard and sees all of their friends -->
			<!-- charred and unconscious. Robin finally come to and is able to relay to Luffy that Eneru -->
			<!-- and Nami went destroy Skypiea. Isa explains the she knows exactly where they went.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>It is so upsetting that Luffy took forever to finally reach the  -->
			<!-- Upper Yard. Remember that since Luffy has the powers of the Gum-Gum fruit, he is made of  -->
			<!-- rubber. Therefore, I think it is pretty safe to assume that Eneru’s electric powers would -->
			<!-- be obsolete when it comes to Luffy because he is literally an insulator. With that being  -->
			<!-- said though I have a feeling that Eneru’s days are numbered once Luffy finally finds him.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <p>The episode seemed to keep the action going much better than episode 180 did. Flashbacks -->
			<!-- were still intermixed with the on going action but they did not intrude  -->
			<!-- on important scenes.</p> -->

			<!-- <h3>Episode 182:</h3> -->
            <!-- <h4>They Finally Clash! Pirate Luffy vs. God Eneru!</h4> -->
			<!-- <p><u><b>Summary</b><br></u>Eneru explains to Nami that with his mantra gave him ability to -->
			<!-- listen to what everyone in Skypiea is saying, therefore he can electrocute anyone who speaks -->
			<!-- bad of him. Nami begins to conjure up ideas of how to escape. However, before Nami can say  -->
			<!-- anything to Eneru he cuts her off and asks if she can hear anyone nearby.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <p>Separately, Conis shows up to Angel Island trying to tell everyone to hurry and leave  -->
			<!-- before he comes and kills them all. Unfortunately, not a single person would listen and  -->
			<!-- demanded that she goes to prison for slandering God Eneru’s name. In anger, Conis screams  -->
			<!-- out, “I refuse to accept that Eneru is god.” This type of behavior normally follows with a -->
			<!-- bolt of lightning coming down and striking the person. All of the townspeople runs far away -->
			<!-- from Conis because they believe the bolt is about to strike her. After realizing that the  -->
			<!-- bolt was not coming, the townspeople began to believe Conis and evacuated immediately.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <p>Like promised Isa lead Luffy right to Nami and Eneru. After a few minutes of reckless -->
			<!-- talking, Luffy runs up the side of the boat and slingshots himself straight toward Eneru. -->
			<!-- Eneru answered by shocking Luffy three times each stronger than the last. After all three -->
			<!-- bolts, Luffy stood tall as if nothing even happened and that's when a Eneru realized he  -->
			<!-- was made of rubber. The episode ends with Luffy connecting one solid punch on Eneru.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <p><u><b>My Thoughts</b><br></u>Most importantly, I would like to say that my prediction -->
			<!-- from the previous episode stands true. I don’t know about you, but seeing Eneru’s lightning -->
			<!-- fail and getting knocked down gave my a rush. Eneru has killed so many people in this Ark -->
			<!-- so it is about time that he starts getting what he deserves. I predict and hope that Luffy -->
			<!-- is able to defeat Eneru thus letting the Shandorians take back the Upper yard as their own -->
			<!-- and letting the townspeople of Angel Island come back to their homes. This episode did a -->
			<!-- wonderful job at building suspense. I am beyond excited to start episode 183!</p> -->
