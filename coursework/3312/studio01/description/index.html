				This assignment was the first time I programmed in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The assignment is
				supposed to display some of the features that are included in these programming languages. With
				that being said, the features of the page are not necessarily supposed to be applicable, however they
				are meant to give some examples of what you can do.

				You can type anything into the text box and push “Submit it” and whatever you typed into the box
				will appear in replace of the “student” in the bordered box underneath. Along with the word being
				replaced the font size, font type, font color and background color are changed. A few things will
				happen when you click the black box with the light blue text. First, the text will change to another
				font and if you click again it will change back. In addition to this, the text in the box will be
				put into the textbox at the top.
