		<h2>Studio02:</h2>
		<hr>
		<div>
			<p>
				Studio02 introduced a plethora of new features such as: radio buttons, check boxes, links, 
				unordered and ordered lists, tables, emphasise, and most importantly divs. The reason for all
				of the red lines is to explain how divs work and what areas they are taking up.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Starting at the top and working down, you can choose only one of the presidents using the radio
				buttons under the legend, “A ballot using plurality voting.” Further down the page under the
				legend, “A ballot using approval voting,” you can select all of the presidents you do or do not
				want. This is possible because they are checkboxes rather than radio boxes. Both the radio boxes
				and checkboxes are in an unordered list which by default is displayed as bullet points. Under
				the heading, “Some advantages,” it displays an ordered list and the use of hyperlinks. Upon
				clicking the links, you are redirected to a wikipedia page giving you the definition of each
				of the following voting terms. A table is displayed right under that and simply displays each
				of the presidents along with some percentages that are independent to each president. Lastly,
				the e-mail address line at the bottom of the page is just to show how to implement this feature,
				however clicking the “Add me!” button does absolutely nothing.
