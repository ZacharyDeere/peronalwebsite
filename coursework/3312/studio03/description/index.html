			<p>
				Studio03 focuses more on the CSS rules than the HTML. This assignment really shows the capabilities
				of CSS and how many things you can really do with it. My eyes were opened to this assignment because
				I loved the visuals we were asked to incorporate, in particular the table showing the baseball teams’
				statistics.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The heading at the top of the page, shows that you are capable of applying a shadow around text. In
				the table right below that we learned that you can separate cells of a table with the background color
				instead of using the borders of the containers. Under the heading, “Lorem ipsum,” we demonstrated that
				it is possible to have a shadow of different shades and colors on the inside of a border. The next two
				sections with the eight magenta colored boxes with shadows on only the right and bottom are contained
				inside a div with a class that adjusts them to be next to each other rather than being on separate lines.
				This is achieved by using flex-direction and flex-wrap. Lastly, the final box is a field set with the
				legend, “Choices,” we exhibit that it is possible to change the border style, in this case the border is
				dashed.
