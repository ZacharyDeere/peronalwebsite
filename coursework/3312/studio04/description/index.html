				This studio was the first assignment that we began to write javascript on our own. The purpose of
				the studio was to implement the functionality of four different modules. These modules were made
				to: convert temperature, draw a single box, hailstone a number and draw nested boxes. 
			</p>
				Going from right to left, The first module is coded to convert temperatures from fahrenheit to
				celsius or celsius to fahrenheit. After the number is converted it will be rounded to the nearest
				thousands place. When testing be sure you click the correct corresponding button otherwise the
				conversion will not occur. The second module is coded to draw a box depending on the number the
				user provides. For example, if the user enters five into the box and then clicks, “Draw the box,”
				a box with a height and width of five will be drawn using asterisks. Unfortunately the space in 
				which an asterisk is placed is not centered perfectly, therefore the box looks more like a rectangle
				than a square. The third module is coded to hailstone a number that the user inputs. In short, if
				the input is even the input will be divided by two and if it is odd, the input will be multiplied by
				three and incremented by one. After each step the input is reassessed depending on the product or the
				incremented quotient. This occurs until the input is reduced to one. Additionally, the module indicates
				how many steps it took to reach one. The fourth module is similar to the second module. This module
				is coded to draw boxes however they are nested inside of each other. Therefore when the user inputs
				a large number it will result in more boxes. When inputting numbers be careful because after about
				nineteen you will need to resize the text box, using the tab in the bottom right corner, to see
				the boxes.
