			<p>
				Studio05 in another assignment that focuses more on the javascript aspect of the web application.
				This studio includes five modules that are coded to do the following: test for prime numbers, 
				calculate fibonacci values, accumate numbers, reverse input, and change colors.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				From right to left, the first module determines if the number the user inputs is prime. The second 
				module gives the nth Fibonacci number and n is based on the input of the user. In short, the Fibonacci
				number is calculated by adding the two numbers that come before together. For example, the
				fourth Fibonacci number is calculated:
				
				<div id = "fibExample"><code>
					N<sub>1</sub> = 1 
					</br>
					N<sub>2</sub> = 1
					</br>
					N<sub>3</sub> = 2 
					</br>
					N<sub>4</sub> = 3
					</br>
					N<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>3</sub> = 3
					</br>
					</br>
				</code></div>
				
				Now, you can see that the two previous numbers are used to calculate the nth value. However, in order
				to do this you must calculate all of the numbers starting from one because every value is dependent on
				the two previous values. The third module simply keeps a running total of all of the numbers you input
				consecutively. This sum will continue to keep track of your running total until the page is refreshed.
				The fourth module takes whatever the user inputs and reverses it once the user clicks out of the text
				box. This can be done using letters and numbers, so be creative! Try entering a palindrome and see
				what happens, notice that capital letters do not get converted to lowercase. The last module, as you
				could probably tell while testing the other modules, changes colors randomly when the user types in
				the textboxes.
