		<h2>About Me:</h2>
		<hr>
		<div>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Zachary Deere. I am a Computer Science undergraduate
				at Angelo State University. Throughout my years at Angelo State I
				have learned many programming languages. I am most fluent in C++ and Java,
				however I also know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Assembly, PHP, Python, and 
				Angelo State's RAMM assembly language.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				I am a student of many interests and have found myself in many different 
				fields of work until I realized my love for computers. I spent my high school
				life working at a fast food restaurant then doubled up on jobs during the summer
				on the family farm shredding CRP for my grandparents. In college I worked a retail
				job and went home during the summers to work in the oil field for the next school
				year's tuition.
			</p>

			<p>
				The most rewarding and fulfilling occupation is the one I go back to everyone summer
				back in my hometown. I am a production tubing inspector and tubing technician for
				Musslewhite Trucking. In short, I inspect production tubing that is ready to be sent downhole
				to pump oil out of the ground. When the joints of tubing are being connected and put 
				downhole it is my responsibility to insure that each connection is fitted with the correct
				sized <em><strong><a href = "http://www.glassbore.com/wedgeringreg.html">WedgeRing®</a></strong></em>
				and to make sure that each connection is tightened perfectly. If the wrong size <em><strong>WedgeRing®</strong></em>
				is used or the connection is too tight or too loose the integrity of the well may be compromised.

			My favorite hobby is watching anime with my girlfriend. The show we are currently watching
			is called <em><strong><a href = "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/One_Piece_Wiki">One Piece</a></strong></em>.
			In short, it is a 800+ episode anime that explains the story of a young pirate who wants to one day be king of the pirates.
			I never thought I would enjoy anime as much as I do now and it makes it so much better
			that I get to enjoy it with my wonderful girlfriend.
